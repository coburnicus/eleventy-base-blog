**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, both Idaho Code Ann. § 33-2002.04 and Idaho Admin. Code r. 08.02.03109.1(a) clearly state that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, Idaho’s transfer of rights statute and regulation do not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* No, Idaho’s transfer of rights statute and regulation do not clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, Idaho Code Ann. § 33-2002.04 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “determined to be incompetent under Idaho law.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Idaho’s transfer of rights statute and regulation do not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* Yes, Idaho Code Ann. § 33-2002.04 authorizes the IEP team to determine a “student lacks the ability to provide informed consent,” halting the transfer, although it does not describe a procedure for doing so.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Idaho.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, the Idaho State Department of Education’s 2018 _Special Education Manual_ section on “[_Transfer of Special Rights_](https://www.sde.idaho.gov/sped/sped-manual/files/chapters/chapter-11-procedural-safeguards/Transfer-of-Special-Education-Rights.pdf)” (updated in 2020) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, unless “the IEP team determines that the student is unable to provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program or the parent has obtained legal guardianship including the scope of educational matters.” Further, the manual expressly expects that “\[e\]ducators, who work with young adults with disabilities, and parents of individuals with disabilities, shall understand the issues regarding special education rights, guardianship, conservatorship, and power of attorney.”
* However, the manual describes an informal process by which the IEP team, at a meeting held at least one year before a student turns 18, collectively reviews “all relevant information related to the student’s ability to understand and make informed decisions regarding educational matters” and then “the team determines if there is any reason to prohibit the transfer of rights.” Moreover, it instructs “\[e\]ducators who are working with students who will be turning 18 years of age should assist families in contacting the appropriate agency for assistance” to seek guardianship, without similarly instructing them to advise parents of alternatives to guardianship. Still, the guidance does provide information about power of attorney, which it implies can prevent parental rights from transferring. Last, the manual does not clarify whether in Idaho court appointment of a conservator prevents rights from transferring to the adult student.
