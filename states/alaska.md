1. **_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to adult students?_**

Yes, Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, § 52.620 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

2. **_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

Yes, Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, § 52.620 clearly states that parental rights also transfer to incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old.

3. **_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

Yes, Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, § 52.620 clearly states that parents have a right to notice.

4. **_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students “adjudicated incompetent”?_**

Yes, Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, § 52.620 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students if “otherwise provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.”

5. **_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

No, Alaska’s special education regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent the transfer of parental rights.

6. **_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

No, the GATOR project has not located an Alaska special education regulation that creates a “special procedure” that prevents parents’ rights from transferring to adult students determined to be unable of giving informed consent.

7. **_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to FAPE is violated?_**

Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue.

8. **_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

Mostly yes. The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development’s 2020 _Guidance for Special Education Personnel_ clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old and that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

However, this guide likely overstates its regulation where it states, “Requirements for parent participation under federal and Alaska law do not hold for students at or above the age of majority, which is 18 in Alaska. The only exception is if a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise determines” (internal citations omitted). Alaska has adopted federal regulation 34 C.F.R. § 300.322, which describes public agency responsibilities for ensuring parents’ participation in IEP Team meetings, including providing notice to the parent. Since Alaska’s transfer of rights regulation recognizes parents’ right to receive notice post-transfer, this portion of the guide is questionable.

Further, although Alaska’s transfer of rights regulation does not expressly mention alternatives to guardianship, this guide fails to mention either how alternatives such as powers of attorney that may be used to prevent parental rights from transferring.

Last, this guide fails to mention that in 2018 Alaska enacted a statute recognized supported decision-making agreements which presumably may be used to navigate transfer of rights concerns and should be incorporated into future guidance.
