**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, S.D. Admin. R. 24:05:30:16.01 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they reach the age of majority, which is 18 years old in South Dakota.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* Yes, S.D. Admin. R. 24:05:30:16.01(3) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students. The South Dakota Department of Education’s 2020 South Dakota Parental Rights and Procedural Safeguards specifies that rights transfer not at the time of incarceration but when the incarcerated student turns 18 years old.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* Yes, S.D. Admin. R. 24:05:30:16.01(1) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, S.D. Admin. R. 24:05:30:16.01 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students who have “been determined to be incompetent.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* No, South Dakota’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* Yes, S.D. Admin. R. 24:05:30:16.01 authorizes school districts to appoint the parent or another appropriate individual as educational representative for adult students “determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to the educational program.” However, South Dakota’s transfer of rights regulation does not describe the process by which this determination is made.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?_**

* Possibly yes. Although the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals’ main holding regarding the statute of limitations in Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. has been superseded by statute, it implied that federal law, not State law, dictates whether parental rights transfer to adult students. 220 F.3d 850, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2000). Although its interpretation was erroneous, this decision suggests that parents may lose the right to bring on behalf of their adult students.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* Yes. The South Dakota Department of Education’s 2020 South Dakota Parental Rights and Procedural Safeguards notice clearly states that parental rights transfer to both incarcerated and non-incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old, that parents have a right to notice post transfer, that adult students “whose rights have been terminated or assigned to another party” are excepted from South Dakota’s transfer of rights regulation, and that school districts may appoint an educational representative if an adult student who “is determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to their educational program.”
* Although this notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship by name, such as a power of attorney, the phrase “whose rights have been terminated or assigned to another party” can be interpreted to include agents appointed through powers of attorney.
