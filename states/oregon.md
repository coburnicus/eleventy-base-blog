**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(1) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they reach the age of majority, which is 18 years old in Oregon.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(5) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2190(6)(b) states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(2)(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students found by a Probate Court “to be incapacitated to make educational decisions.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(4) allows adult students to “request that a surrogate be appointed.”

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, Oregon does not have a statute or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Likely yes. See Oman v. Portland Pub. Sch., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45612 (D. Ore. Sept. 10, 2005) (acknowledging Oregon’s transfer-of-rights policy but dismissing parent plaintiff’s claims as moot).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Mostly yes. The Oregon Department of Education’s 2016-2017 Procedural Safeguards Notice clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old and that adult students may request appointment of a surrogate, but overstates its regulation where it states that right “transfer to the student at the age of majority unless the court has appointed a legal guardian to act on their behalf,” since a surrogate appointment would also prevent parental rights from transferring to the student.
- Also, this notice fails to mention that parents retain a right to notice post transfer. By contrast, Disability Rights Oregon’s 2012 Special Education Guide for Parents does clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.
