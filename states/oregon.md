**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(1) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they reach the age of majority, which is 18 years old in Oregon.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(5) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2190(6)(b) states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(2)(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students found by a Probate Court “to be incapacitated to make educational decisions.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* Yes, Or. Admin. R. 581-015-2325(4) allows adult students to “request that a surrogate be appointed.”

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* No, Oregon does not have a statute or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?_**

* Likely yes. See Oman v. Portland Pub. Sch., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45612 (D. Ore. Sept. 10, 2005) (acknowledging Oregon’s transfer of rights policy but dismissing parent plaintiff’s claims as moot).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* Mostly yes. The Oregon Department of Education’s 2016-2017 Procedural Safeguards Notice clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old and that adult students may request appointment of a surrogate, but overstates its regulation where it states that right “transfer to the student at the age of majority unless the court has appointed a legal guardian to act on their behalf,” since a surrogate appointment would also prevent parental rights from transferring to the student.
* Also, this notice fails to mention that parents retain a right to notice post transfer. By contrast, Disability Rights Oregon’s 2012 Special Education Guide for Parents does clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.
