**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, Utah Admin. Code r. 277-750-2 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer when students turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* Yes, Utah State Bd. of Educ. \[USBE\], Special Education Rules VI.J.1 & VI.W.1(c) clearly state that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* Yes, USBE Special Education Rule VI.W.1(a) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, USBE Special Education Rule VI.W.1 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students who have been “determined to be incompetent under State law.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* No, Utah’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship for preventing parental rights from transferring.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* No, Utah’s transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure for appointing an educational representative for students deemed unable of giving informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?_**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Utah.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* Mostly yes. The USBE’s 2016 Special Education Rights of Parents and Children: Procedural Safeguards Notice copies word for word the language of its transfer of rights regulation, but without elaborating on the regulation. Moreover, this notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, that may also prevent parental rights from transferring.
