**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, 07-034 Miss. Code R. § 300.520(a) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they reach the age of majority in Mississippi, which is 21 years old. However, per Miss. Code Ann. §§ 37-23-1 & 3, special education services are provided only through the age of 20, rendering it unlikely that in practice parental rights transfer to any adult students receiving special education services.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* Yes, 07-034 Miss. Code R. § 300.520(a)(2) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to incarcerated students. The Mississippi Department of Education’s Procedures for State Board Policy 74.19 clarifies that rights transfer upon incarceration if the student is incarcerated as an adult.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, 07-034 Miss. Code R. § 300.520(a)(1)(i) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, 07-034 Miss. Code R. § 300.520(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students who have been “determined to be incompetent.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Mississippi’s special education regulations do not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* Yes, 07-034 Miss. Code R. § 300.520(b) states that the Mississippi Department of Education has established procedures for an educational representative for an adult student “who has reached the age of majority, but has not been determined to be incompetent, can be determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to the child's educational program.” However, the GATOR project team has not located a Mississippi Department of Education policy outlining these procedures.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer**?

* Yes. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals held that IDEA rights must be asserted by the rights-holders, meaning that parents are estopped from asserting their adult children’s IDEA rights post transfer; however, in this case the student’s parents “corrected this defect” in their standing once they obtained guardianship. Reyes v. Manor Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 16-50542 (5th Cir. May 11, 2017).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, the Mississippi Department of Education’s Procedures for State Board Policy 74.19 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 21 years old, except for students who have “been determined to be incompetent under state law.” It also states that parents have a right to notice post transfer, unless rights have transferred to students who have been incarcerated as adults. However, it fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that might prevent parental rights from transferring, such as a power of attorney.
