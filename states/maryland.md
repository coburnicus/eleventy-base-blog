**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- Yes, Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-412.1(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, unless one of six narrow conditions relating to parents’ documented unavailability are met.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, but because parental rights presumptively do not transfer to students at the age of majority, they also would not transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- No, but because parental rights presumptively do not transfer to students at the age of majority, parents retain all rights.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- Yes, Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-412.1(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students who have been “adjudged incompetent under State law.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- Yes, Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-412.1(b) clearly states that parents may file a due process complaint to prevent rights from transferring to students turning 18 years old who satisfy one of the six conditions enumerated at § 8-412.1(a).

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, Md. Code Ann., Educ. § 8-412.1 does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Maryland.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Yes, the Maryland State Department of Education’s 2002 Resource Information on the transfer-of-rights at the Age of Majority clearly explains that parental rights transfer to students who turn 18 years old only under “limited circumstances” where “the parents are not involved or available.” Per this resource, “\[t\]he statute applies to very few students.”
