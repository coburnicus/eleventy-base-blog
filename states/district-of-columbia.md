**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, D.C. Code § 38-2571.04(a) and D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5, § E3034.1 clearly state that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, Washington, DC’s transfer of rights law and regulation do not specify whether rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* No, Washington, DC’s transfer of rights law and regulation do not specify that parents have a right to notice, even though federal regulations clearly do so.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, D.C. Code § 38-2571.04(a)(1) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “adjudged incompetent.” Similarly, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5, § E3035.1(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student “declared a legally incapacitated individual.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* Yes, both Washington, DC’s transfer of rights law and regulation mention two alternatives to guardianship. D.C. Code § 38-2571.04(a)(3) clearly allows adult students to use a “power of attorney or similar legal document” to authorize another to exercise parental rights, as does D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5, § E3035.1(b). Additionally, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5, § E3034.3 mentions written “\[s\]upported decision-making arrangements” which enable adult students to receive support from others for educational decisions notwithstanding rights transfers, consistent with D.C. Code § 38-2571.04(b).

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* Yes, D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5, §§ E3035.3 through 15 describe a special procedure whereby Washington, DC’s Office of the Statue Superintendent of Education (OSSE) may appoint an educational representative for adult students determined “to not have the ability to provide informed consent regarding educational decisions.”
* The OSSE may appoint an educational representative if requested in writing by the student’s parent, legal guardian, or another interested adult, and if two different licensed professionals certify that any one of the following is true:

  “(a) The student is unable to understand, on a continuing or consistent basis, the nature, extent, and probable consequences of an educational decision or proposed educational program;

  (b) The student is unable to evaluate the benefits or disadvantages of an educational decision or a proposed educational program as compared with alternative options on a continuing or consistent basis; or (c) The student is unable to communicate understanding verbally, in writing, or in the mode of communication used by the student to communicate his or her decisions, an understanding of or an evaluation of the benefits or disadvantages of an educational decision or proposed educational program.” Id. at 3035.8
* These certifications “shall not be construed as a finding of incompetence or incapacity for any other purpose or as relevant or precedential evidence in any future court or legal action seeking to remove decision-making authority for the student.” Id. at 3035.12

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Probably yes. The Washington, DC District Court has held that parents may not sue on their adult child’s behalf, while nevertheless allowing a parent to substitute her child as plaintiff in a suit, thereby permitting the parent’s claims to proceed despite the transfer of parental rights. Brooks v. District of Columbia, 841 F. Supp. 2d 253 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2012). See also Presely v. Friendship Pub. Charter Sch., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31974 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2013) (granting student plaintiff sua sponte leave to file a motion to substitute herself as the sole plaintiff prior to the issuance of an order on the pending motions).
* The District Court has also allowed at least one pair of parents to sue for tuition reimbursement even though parental rights had transferred. Latynski-Rossiter v. District of Columbia, 928 F. Supp. 2d 57 (D.D.C. Mar. 5, 2013). For the court, that right to reimbursement did not dissipate simply because student became adult, and court was unwilling to endorse interpretation of act Act which might stymie IDEA’s overarching purpose.
* Relatedly, D.C. courts are likely to recognize duly executed powers of attorney. See Shaw v. District of Columbia, 2019 U.S. Dist. 20526 (D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2019).
* Unrelatedly, school districts may seek to influence, even bribe, adult students and separate them from supporters. See Blackman v. District of Columbia, 72 F.Supp. 3d 249 (D.D.C. Nov. 4, 2014) (reproaching school district for “totally indefensible” and “egregious” conduct, i.e. barring adult student’s attorney from attending IEP meeting, summoning police to remove attorney from school premises, and attempting to bribe student ex parte with an iPad).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, District of Columbia Public Schools’ “Transfer of Rights” [webpage](https://dcps.dc.gov/page/transfer-rights) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, unless they have legal guardians or have executed a power of attorney. This webpage also states that school district representatives are required to inform students and parents of supported decision-making as an alternative to guardianship. However, this webpage does not state whether parents have a right to notice post-transfer, which may conflict with federal regulations stating that parents have a right to notice even if other rights transfer.
