**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 15-773 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, Arizona’s transfer of rights statute does not clearly state that parental rights also transfer to students if they are incarcerated.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* No, Arizona’s transfer of rights statute does not specify that parents have a right to notice, even though federal regulations clearly do so.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 15-773(A) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students if “declared legally incompetent.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* Yes, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 15-773(B) does clearly mention a student’s right to “execute a delegation of right to make educational decisions,” but only if the student “manifests the capacity to give and gives informed consent.”

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* No, the GATOR project has not located an Arizona special education regulation that creates a “special procedure” that prevents parents’ rights from transferring to adult students determined to be unable of giving informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Arkansas.
* Although the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals’ main holding regarding the statute of limitations in Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. has been superseded by statute, worth noting is that it appears to have committed two errors relating to its interpretation of the IDEA’s transfer of rights provisions. First, it erroneously implied that federal law, not State law, dictates whether parental rights transfer to adult students. Second, it erroneously implied that parents do not have a right to notice post transfer when it reasoned that the 1997 IDEA amendments did not cure the school district’s failure to provide notice to an adult student’s parent ratione temporis. 220 F.3d 850, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2000).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Mostly yes. The Arizona Department of Education’s 2013 _Secure Care Special Education Policies and Procedures_ clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, except for students who have “been determined to be incompetent,” and that parents have a right to notice post transfer. However, these policies fail to mention what Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 15-773(B) expressly provides: that an adult student may “execute a delegation of right to make educational decisions,” thereby avoiding transfer. Similarly, the Department’s _Indicator 13 Transition Services: Transfer of Rights at Age of Majority_ factsheet fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.
* By contrast, Arizona’s protection and advocacy agency, the Arizona Center for Disability Law, published a guide in 2007 entitled _Understanding Your Child’s Educational Rights_ that does describe the “Delegation of Right to Make Educational Decisions” alternative.
