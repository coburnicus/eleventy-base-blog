**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* No, the GATOR project team has not located a North Dakota special education statute or regulations that clearly states whether parental rights transfer to adult students. However, the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction’s 2020 Parental Rights for Public School Students Receiving Special Education Services:  Notice of Procedural Safeguards indicates that in North Dakota parental rights are presumed to transfer when students turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, North Dakota’s special education statute and regulations do not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* No, North Dakota’s special education statute and regulations do not clearly state whether parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* No, North Dakota’s special education statute and regulations do not clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to adult students for whom legal guardians have been appointed.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, North Dakota’s special education statute and regulations do not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, North Dakota’s special education statute and regulations do not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable of giving informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in North Dakota.
* Although the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals’ main holding regarding the statute of limitations in Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. has been superseded by statute, worth noting is that it appears to have committed two errors relating to its interpretation of the IDEA’s transfer of rights provisions. First, it erroneously implied that federal law, not State law, dictates whether parental rights transfer to adult students. Second, it erroneously implied that parents do not have a right to notice post transfer when it reasoned that the 1997 IDEA amendments did not cure the school district’s failure to provide notice to an adult student’s parent ratione temporis. 220 F.3d 850, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2000).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly yes. The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction’s 2020 Parental Rights for Public School Students Receiving Special Education Services:  Notice of Procedural Safeguards indicates that in North Dakota parental rights are presumed to transfer when a student turns 18 years old unless the student “is determined not to be competent under state law.” 
* However, this notice fails to state that parents have a right to notice post transfer pursuant to federal law. Also, it fails to mention alternatives to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, that may prevent parental rights from transferring. Last, it fails to mention how supported decision-making agreements, which North Dakota gave formal recognition through a 2019 statute, may be used to navigate transfer of rights concerns.
