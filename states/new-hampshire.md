**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* Yes, N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed 1120.01 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, New Hampshire’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* No, New Hampshire’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed 1120.0(b) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student who has been “adjudicated incompetent.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* Yes, N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Ed 1120.01(c) clearly states that students may execute powers of attorney to prevent parental rights from transferring. 

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, New Hampshire’s transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in New Hampshire.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly no. The New Hampshire State Department of Education’s 2018 Special Education Procedural Safeguards Handbook does not mention the transfer of IDEA rights when students turn 18 years old, although it does mention the transfer of rights to access educational records pursuant to FERPA. 
* However, in 2016 the New Hampshire State Department of Education published a model Special Education Policies and Procedures Manual for school districts to tailor. This manual states, “All of the rights and guarantees included under procedural safeguards shall apply to parents, adult students, and public agencies, which include school districts.  These rights shall be transferred to children with disabilities who are emancipated minors or who have attained the age of 18 years and have not been adjudicated as incompetent by a court.” This manual fails to state that parents have a right to notice post transfer in accordance with federal law, however, and it fails to mention whether alternatives to guardianship such as a power of attorney may be used to prevent parental rights from transferring.
