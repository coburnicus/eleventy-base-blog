**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, both 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/14-6.10 and Ill. Admin. Code tit. 23, § 226.690 clearly state that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* Yes, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 23, § 226.690(b)(2) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 23, § 226.690(b)(1) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/14-6.10(c)(1) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students adjudged “incompetent under State law,” while Ill. Admin Code tit. 23, § 226.690(a) similarly prevents parental rights from transferring to students adjudged “a disabled person” as defined by Illinois’ guardianship statute.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* Yes, 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/14-6.10(c)(2) clearly authorizes adult students to use a “Delegation of Rights” form, which must be renewed annually, to prevent parental rights from transferring. Use of this form has been upheld by an Illinois district court in Stanek v. St. Charles Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. #303, 783 F.3d 634 (tbd).

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure”  to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* No, Illinois’s transfer of rights statute and regulation do not create a special procedure for determining adult students to lack capacity to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Yes. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals held that only an 18-year-old student, not her parents, could sue her school. Loch v. Edwardsville Sch. Dist. No. 7, 327 Fed. Appx. 647 (7th Cir. 2009). See also Considine-Brechon v. Dixon Pub. Sch. Dist. #170, No. 16-C-50133, 70 IDELR 39 (N.D. Ill. June 8, 2017).
* However, duly executed delegations of rights allow adult students to confer standing on their parents. Stanek v. St. Charles Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist., 783 F.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015); In re R.O.W.V.A. Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist., Ill. State Educ. Agency No. 2008-0560, 113 LRP 5316 (June 8, 2009). Completing delegations of rights before due process hearings, even if subsequent to filing of complaints, may be sufficient to confer standing on parents. In re Chicago Pub. Sch. Dist. #299, Ill. State Educ. Agency No. 2010-0112, 110 LRP 50962 (May 19, 2010).
* Relatedly, failure to provide notice of transfer of rights alone is unlikely to result in a FAPE violation. See T.G. v. Midland Sch. Dist. 7, 542 Fed. Appx. 523 (7th Cir. 2013).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Mostly yes, the Illinois State Board of Education’s 2009 Educational Rights and Responsibilities: Understanding Special Education in Illinois guide clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old. It also affirmatively obligates school districts to “inform the parents and student of the student’s right to delegate decision-making to another adult individual” and also to “provide the student with a copy of the Delegation of Rights form.” However, this guide does not state that parents have a right to notice post transfer or that guardianship also prevents rights from transferring.
