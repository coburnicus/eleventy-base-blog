**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* Yes, Minn. R. 3525.2810(1)(A) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* Yes, Minn. R. 3525.2810(1)(A) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* Yes, Minn. R. 3525.2810(1)(A) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, Minn. R. 3525.2810(1)(A) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student for whom “guardian or conservator has been appointed . . . by a court of competent jurisdiction.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, Minnesota’s transfer of or rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent parental rights from transferring.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, Minnesota’s transfer of or rights regulation does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent. See In re St. Paul Indep. Sch. Dist. #625, Minn. State Educ. Agency No. 07-092C, 07 LRP 60685 (June 4, 2007).

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**

* Probably yes. A state review officer concluded that the school district lacked the authority to appoint a surrogate parent for the student, as a special procedure pursuant to 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415(m)(2) had not been created. Also, the parent had standing based on a guardianship order the parent obtained after the school district’s purported surrogate appointment. In re St. Paul Indep. Sch. Dist. #625, Minn. State Educ. Agency No. 07-092C, 07 LRP 60685 (June 4, 2007) (ordering the school district “to immediately cease any practice of appointing 18-year-old students a surrogate parent following an IEP determination that the student is not capable or competent to make educational decisions for him/herself”).
* Although the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals’ main holding regarding the statute of limitations in Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. has been superseded by statute, it implied that federal law, not State law, dictates whether parental rights transfer to adult students. 220 F.3d 850, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2000). Although its interpretation was erroneous, this decision reinforces the likelihood that parents lose the right to bring on behalf of their adult students in Minnesota.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* No, the Minnesota Department of Education’s 2014 Part B Notice of Procedural Safeguards: Parental Rights for Public School Special Education Students merely states that “\[t\]hese same procedural safeguards are also available for students with disabilities who reached the age of 18.” Elsewhere, the notice mentions the transfer of rights, but in the context of accessing educational records under the Federal Education Records Protection Act (FERPA), not with regard to IDEA rights. Additionally, this notice fails to mention that guardianship or conservatorship prevent parental rights from transferring, as described in Minnesota’s transfer of rights regulation. Last, this notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring, such as a power of attorney.
