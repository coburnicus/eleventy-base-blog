**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-6.03311(8) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* Yes, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-6.03311(8)(d) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old. But in such cases, parents do not retain the right to notice.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* No, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-6.03311(8)(b) states that parents only have a right to notice regarding the transfer, but not post transfer. This provision likely conflicts with federal law, which requires that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-6.03311(8)(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “determined incompetent under State law or who has had a guardian advocate appointed.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* No, Florida’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent the transfer of parental rights.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* Yes, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-6.03311(8)(e) allows parents to “\[b\]e appointed to represent the educational interests of their student” without an adjudication of incapacity by becoming a “guardian advocate.”

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**

* Likely yes. _Castillo v. Sch. Bd. of Broward Cnty._, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186579 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (agreeing “with Defendants that this action must also be dismissed for lack of standing, as Plaintiff, Mery Castillo, does not have standing to bring an action on behalf of her son, Yanni Castillo, who was not a minor at the time Plaintiff filed the Complaint, and is not alleged to have been determined incompetent under state law”).
* Similarly, a Florida hearing officer, while stopping a school district from challenging one pair of parents’ standing to claim FAPE violations on behalf of their adult son, implied that the parents might have lacked standing had the school district fulfilled its duty to notify the parents of the rights transfer. Fla. Div. Admin. Hr’gs, Case No. 04-0898E, In re Miami-Dade County School District (July 12, 2004).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* Mostly yes. The Florida Department of Education’s 2012 _A Parent’s Introduction to Exceptional Student Education in Florida_ clearly states that “all” parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, unless students have been adjudicated incompetent or have been appointed a guardian advocate for educational decisions. While this may be true per Florida’s regulations, federal law requires that parents have a right to notice post transfer. However, this guide fails to mention other alternatives to guardianship, such as an education power of attorney, which presumably would also prevent parental rights transfers.
