**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(1) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, New Mexico’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(1)(a) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(1) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student if the student has “a court-appointed general guardian, limited guardian, or other person who has been authorized by a court to make educational decisions on the student's behalf.” Moreover, N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(2) affirmatively obligates school districts to discuss, “as appropriate,” ”the parents' plans for obtaining a guardian” at every annual IEP review meeting after a student turns 14 years old.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* Yes, N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(1) clearly states that a power of attorney prevents parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* No, N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(1) does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent. Instead, it clarifies that such a procedure would be contrary to New Mexico law: “A guardianship proceeding under the probate code is the only way an adult in New Mexico can legally be determined to be incompetent and have the right to make his or her own decisions taken away. Public agencies and their IEP teams are not empowered to make such determinations under New Mexico law.” See also In re Grants/Cibola Cnty. Schs., N.M. State Educ. Agency No. DPH 0607-01, 107 LRP 32695 (Oct. 9, 2006).

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Likely no. New Mexico’s district court has allowed a suit, filed before a student’s 18th birthday, to proceed despite parental rights transferring, merely noting this formality in a footnote while adjudicating the merits of the mother’s claims. Garcia v. Bd. of Educ., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96703, n.1 (D.N.M. Jan. 10, 2007) (“The minor student, Myisha Garcia, turned eighteen during the pendency of this case, which shifted legal standing under the IDEA from Myisha's mother.”).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Mostly no. The New Mexico Public Education Department’s 2014 Policies and Procedures for the Provision of Special Education Services for Students with Disabilities and Gifted Students copies its transfer of rights regulation word for word without further commentary. Similarly, the Department’s 2010 Graduation Options for Students with Disabilities: Technical Assistance Manual reproduces its transfer of rights regulation verbatim without additional explanation.
* The Department’s 2014 Parent and Child Rights in Special Education Procedural Safeguards Notice likely overstates its regulation. It states: “In New Mexico, children become legal adults at age 18. Under the IDEA, they are then entitled to make their own educational decisions and protect their own rights unless the courts have declared them incompetent and appointed guardians for them. Unless this is completed before the child’s 18th birthday, the child will automatically have all rights and responsibilities of adulthood when he or she reaches the age of 18, which includes making educational decisions. The district will inform the parent of the laws and options regarding transfer of rights beginning at each annual Individual Education Program (IEP) review for a child who is 14 or older.” This notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring, such as a power of attorney, as expressly stated in N.M. Code R. § 6.31.2.13(K)(1).
