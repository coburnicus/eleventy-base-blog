**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, both Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 29.017(a) and 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1049(a) clearly state that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* Yes, both Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 29.017(b) and 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1049(b) clearly state that parental rights transfer to adult students who are incarcerated when they turn 18 years old.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, both Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 29.017(a) and 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1049(a) clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1049(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students for whom a guardianship has been appointed.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* Yes, 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1049(a) requires that a student’s IEPs “state that the student has been provided information and resources regarding guardianship, alternatives to guardianship, including a supported decision-making agreement under Texas Estates Code, Chapter 1357, and other supports and services that may enable the student to live independently.” Moreover, 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1049(e) states, “Nothing in this section prohibits a supported decision-making agreement or a valid power of attorney from being executed by an individual who holds rights under IDEA, Part B.” See also Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 29.017(e). Last, Tex. Educ. Code Ann. § 29.017(c-2) obligates school districts to provide to students or parents information and resources on supported decision-making agreements if either requests information on guardianship or alternatives to guardianship.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* No, Texas’ transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure for appointing an educational representative for students deemed unable of giving informed consent. See Reyes v. Manor Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 16-50542 (5th Cir. May 11, 2017) (noting Texas’ failure to do so).

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Yes. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals held that IDEA rights must be asserted by the rights-holders, meaning that parents are stopped from asserting their adult children’s IDEA rights post transfer; however, in this case the student’s parents “corrected this defect” in their standing once they obtained guardianship. Reyes v. Manor Indep. Sch. Dist., 850 F.3d 251 (5th Cir. May 11, 2017). See also Oliver v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17117 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 29, 2003). But see K.F. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193921, *11-12 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 26, 2013) (opting to rule on the merits of Plaintiff’s claims despite the IDEA’s “plain language” given the Houston school district’s failure to cite “any federal courts interpreting the Code of Federal Regulations and the Texas Education Code to prohibit parents from bringing claims under the IDEA based on a school district's rendering of special education services to their adult child”). That said, an adult student’s FAPE claims will be heard if he or she has executed a power of attorney and if is the named plaintiff. Klein Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Hovem, 745 F. Supp. 2d 700 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 27, 2010).
* Also, a completed statutory durable power of attorney is sufficient to allow parents to bring IDEA claims on behalf of their adult children. See Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Woody, 178 F.Supp. 3d 443 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 15, 2016).
* Note: a unique class action will likely settle regarding a hearing officer decision denying the request of a father of a student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD"), learning disabilities, fetal alcohol syndrome, and significant cognitive impairments to be appointed as adult student’s next friend under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 44. J.A. v. Tex. Educ. Agency, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108362 (W.D. Tex. June 21, 2020). Hearing officers prior to this settlement have frequently declined appoint parents of adult children as next friends. See McArthur v. Killeen Indep. Sch. Dist., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22441 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 22, 2017) (declining to hold that court’s appointment of plaintiff as next friend “cured” failure to be so appointed for due process complaint), subsequently withdrawn by 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224420 (Feb. 22, 2017).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, the Texas Education Agency’s 2017 Notice of Procedural Safeguards clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, that parents have a right to notice post transfer, that parental rights also transfer to incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old, that supported decision-making agreements will allow parents to continue to participate in their adult students’ IEP meetings, and that school districts must provide parents with information about guardianship and alternatives to guardianship on or before their child turns 17 years old. Moreover, Tex. Educ. Code Ann § 29.0112(b)(7) requires that the Texas Education Agency publish a transition and employment guide for students and their parents that includes information on both guardianship and alternatives to guardianship.
