* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in West Virginia.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* Mostly yes. The West Virginia Department of Education’s Age of Majority: Transfer of Rights for Exceptional Students brochure clearly states that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old unless they have “a court-appointed legal guardian or court-appointed surrogate parent” and that parents will continue to receive notice of IEP meetings.
* However, this brochure fails to mention alternatives to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, that avoid the transfer of parental rights
