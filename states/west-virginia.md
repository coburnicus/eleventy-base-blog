**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- Yes, W. Va. Code R. § 126-16-5(9) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, West Virginia’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not clearly state that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- Yes, W. Va. Code R. § 126-16-5(9)(C) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- Yes, W. Va. Code R. § 126-16-5(9)(A) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students for whom a guardianship has been appointed.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- No, West Virginia’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, West Virginia’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not create a special procedure to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in West Virginia.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Mostly yes. The West Virginia Department of Education’s Age of Majority: transfer-of-rights for Exceptional Students brochure clearly states that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old unless they have “a court-appointed legal guardian or court-appointed surrogate parent” and that parents will continue to receive notice of IEP meetings.
- However, this brochure fails to mention alternatives to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, that avoid the transfer of parental rights.
