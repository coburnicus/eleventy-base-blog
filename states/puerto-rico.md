**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- No, Puerto Rico does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students rights at the age of majority, which is 21 years old in Puerto Rico. See Departamento de Educación de Puerto Rico, Manual de Educación Especial 60 (2019).

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, Puerto Rico does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- No, Puerto Rico does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- No, Puerto Rico does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- No, Puerto Rico does not have a statute or regulation that clearly mentions alternatives to guardianship.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Puerto Rico.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Mostly not. The Puerto Rico Departamento de Educación’s 2019 Manual de Educación Especial provides several confusing statements regarding transfer-of-rights. Although it does state that parental rights transfer when students turn 21 years old, on page 218 it confusingly states that students and parents have a right merely to notification of the transfer-of-rights at the moment the transfer occurs, while on page 60 it states that notice will be provided at least one year before the student turns 21 years old. Similarly, page 218 appears to indicate that the right to notice applies to incarcerated students but not to students adjudicated incompetent. The best interpretation of these statements is likely that parents and students will receive notice of the transfer-of-rights both one year before students turn 21 years old and again when transfer occurs, and that the transfer-of-rights (not only notification) applies to students upon incarceration and not for adult students adjudicated incompetent.
