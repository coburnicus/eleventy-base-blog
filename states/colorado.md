**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- Yes, Colo. Code Regs. § 301-8, 2220-R-6.02(9) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 21 years old. Note, however, that students’ right to special education services ends no later than the end of the semester in which they turn 21.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, Colorado’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not specify whether rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- No, Colorado’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not specify that parents have a right to notice, even though federal regulations clearly do so.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- No, Colorado’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not exclude adult students with legal guardians. However, the Colorado Department of Education’s Important Transition Ages and Milestones factsheet states that the rights of adult students with guardians do not transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- No, Colorado’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent the transfer of parental rights.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, the GATOR project has not located a Colorado special education regulation that creates a “special procedure” that prevents parents’ rights from transferring to adult students determined to be unable of giving informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Colorado.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Mostly yes. The Colorado State Department of Education’s 2015 Important Transition Ages and Milestones factsheet clearly states that all parental rights transfer to students when they turn 21 years old. However, this conflicts with federal regulations stating that parents have a right to notice even if other rights transfer. Perhaps worryingly, this factsheet also states that “\[s\]pecial education service providers or agency personnel may be able to assist parents with the \[guardianship\] process,” which may suggest that schools fail to inform parents of alternatives to guardianship that also prevent rights transfer.
