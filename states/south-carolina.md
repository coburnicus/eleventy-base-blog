**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* Yes, both S.C. Code Ann. § 59-33-330 and S.C. Code Regs. 43-243(F)(2)(a) clearly state that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, neither South Carolina’s transfer of rights statute or regulation clearly states if parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* No, neither South Carolina’s transfer of rights statute or regulation clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer consistent with federal law.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, S.C. Code Regs. 43-243(F)(2)(a) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “determined to be incompetent under the laws of South Carolina.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* Yes, S.C. Code Ann. § 59-33-330 clearly states that students may complete a “delegation of right to make educational decisions” form to avoid parental rights from transferring. Additionally, S.C. Code Ann. § 59-33-320 states that an adult student may not be denied “the right to have an adult of his choice support the student in making decisions regarding the student’s individualized education program.”

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* Yes, S.C. Code Ann. § 59-33-340 creates a special procedure for appointing an educational representative for a student “identified as incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences with respect to his educational program” as early as 60 days before turning 18 years old. A representative may be appointed where a student’s physician, nurse practitioner, physician’s assistant, psychologist, or psychiatrist examines the student and certifies in writing both the student’s present incapability to communicate his wishes, interests, or preferences and that this incapability will likely continue after the student turns 21 years old. An incapability determination must be based on either the student’s inability either to “express, either verbally, through an interpreter, or through augmented communication devices, his wishes, interests, or preferences for his education program; or \[to\] understand, even with the support from family, administrators, and experts in the field, what choices are available in a proposed education decision or program.” Students must be notified in writing and have the right to challenge their certification in writing at any time during representatives’ appointments.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in South Carolina.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Yes. The South Carolina Office of Special Education Services’ 2013 Special Education Process Guide for South Carolina clearly states that parental right transfer to students when they turn 18 years old unless adjudicated “incompetent,” that parents have a right to notice post transfer, and that students may choose to assign their rights using a power of attorney under S. C. Code Ann. § 62-5-501. 
* Additionally, the South Carolina Department of Education issued a memorandum in 2016 to district superintendents informing them of the Adult Students with Disabilities Educational Rights Consent Act’s key provisions clearly enumerating the five ways the educational rights of adult students may be exercised or assigned:

1. Student makes educational decisions (automatically occurs at the age of majority– eighteen years old); 
2. Student makes educational decisions with support and assistance of an adult of his or her choice (informal arrangement); 
3. Student delegates educational rights to an agent (using a delegation form or power of attorney); 
4. A representative is appointed to represent the educational interests of an adult student while he or she is in school (using certification process that involves a medical professional); and 
5. Educational rights, along with other rights, are assigned to a court-appointed guardian (using Probate Court process). 

* The South Carolina protection and advocacy agency, Protection & Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc., published a similarly clear fact sheet in 2016.
