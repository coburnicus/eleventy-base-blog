**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, both Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 388.457(1) and Nev. Admin. Code § 388.195(1) clearly state that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, neither Nevada’s transfer of rights statute nor regulations clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, both Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 388.457(3)(b) and Nev. Admin. Code § 388.195(2) clearly state that parents retain a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, both Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 388.457(4) and Nev. Admin. Code § 388.195(3) clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to the adult student if “a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicates a pupil with a disability incapacitated.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Nebraska’s transfer of rights statute and regulations do not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring to adult students other than the special procedure created pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 388.459 and Nev. Admin. Code § 388.197, which is described in greater detail below in the next response.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* Yes, Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 388.459 and Nev. Admin. Code § 388.197 create a procedure by which parents may apply to be appointed educational representatives of students with “significant cognitive impairments.” Parents may apply to the Department of Education using a prescribed form as soon as a student turns 16 years old, but no later than 90 days before the student’s eighteenth birthday, although the appointment becomes effective only when the student turns 18 years old. Parents must declare their belief that the student “does not have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to his or her own educational program.” Either the parent or student may appeal the Department’s determination through a due process complaint. Students have a right to notice even where parents are appointed educational representatives, per Nev. Admin. Code § 388.195(2).

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Nevada.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* No, the Nevada Department of Education’s Office of Inclusive Education does not appear to have issued guidance regarding transfer of rights. However, the State’s designated protection and advocacy agency, the Nevada Disability Advocacy and Law Center, in 2016 published a Transition Services Planning Handbook that provides limited information about parental rights transferring when students without guardians turn 18 years old and about the educational representative appointment procedure.
* Further, note that in 2019 Nevada enacted a statute formally recognizing supported decision-making agreements, which presumably may be used to navigate transfer of rights concerns and should be incorporated into future guidance.
