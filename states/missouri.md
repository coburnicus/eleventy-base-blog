**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- No, Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 20, § 300.110 does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to adult students. Instead, it incorporates the federal regulations by reference because “\[t\]he secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive.” However, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s 2008 Parent’s Guide to Special Education in Missouri indicates that parental rights do transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, Missouri’s special education regulations do not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- No, Missouri’s special education regulations do not clearly state whether parents have a right to notice post transfer. However, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s 2008 Parent’s Guide to Special Education in Missouri indicates that parents have a right to notice post transfer only if the adult student “is still a dependent under Internal Revenue Service rules (living at home and supported by you).”

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- No, Missouri’s special education regulations do not clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to students who have been adjudicated incompetent.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- No, Missouri’s special education regulations do not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, Missouri’s special education regulations do not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Missouri.
- Although the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals’ main holding regarding the statute of limitations in Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. has been superseded by statute, worth noting is that it appears to have committed two errors relating to its interpretation of the IDEA’s transfer-of-rights provisions. First, it erroneously implied that federal law, not State law, dictates whether parental rights transfer to adult students. Second, it erroneously implied that parents do not have a right to notice post transfer when it reasoned that the 1997 IDEA amendments did not cure the school district’s failure to provide notice to an adult student’s parent ratione temporis. 220 F.3d 850, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2000).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Mostly not, while Missouri’s regulations themselves are unclear. Although the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s 2008 Parent’s Guide to Special Education in Missouri clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, and that parents have the right to notice post transfer if their adult students live with them and are financially supported by them, it fails to mention whether guardianship and its alternatives may prevent rights from transferring.
- However, a sample transfer-of-rights notification letter dated January 31, 2012 does alert parents to the possibility of preventing rights from transferring if the student executes a power of attorney: “When a child with a disability turns 18 some parents obtain a power of attorney so they can assist the child in making financial and legal decisions. The child is not declared incompetent but the parents are given the right to act on their behalf. A power of attorney can be revoked at any time.”
