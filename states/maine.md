**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* No, Maine does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states whether parental rights transfer to adult students, because Maine has adopted the federal regulations by reference and federal regulations delegate to the States the decision whether parental rights should transfer. That said, 05-071-101 Me. Code R. app. 1, at page 256 appears to indicate that parental rights do transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, albeit not clearly. 

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, Maine does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students. That said, 05-071-101 Me. Code R. app. 1, at page 256 appears to indicate that parental rights do transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration, consistent with federal regulations.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* No, Maine does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer. That said, 05-071-101 Me. Code R. app. 1, at page 256 appears to indicate that parents have a right to notice post transfer, consistent with federal regulations.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* No, Maine does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer. That said, 05-071-101 Me. Code R. app. 1, at page 256 appears to indicate that parental rights do not transfer to students who have “been determined incompetent under State law.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, Maine’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent parental rights from transferring.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure”  to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, Maine does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer. Although 05-071-101 Me. Code R. app. 1, at page 256 appears to indicate that the State must establish special procedures, guidance from Maine’s Department of Education does not indicate that this has happened. 

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Maine.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* No, the Maine Department of Education’s 2020 Special Education Required Forms Procedural Manual makes scant mention of its transfer of rights regulation.
