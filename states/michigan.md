**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, Michigan’s transfer of or rights regulation does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students, although the Michigan Department of Education’s 2018 Procedural Safeguards Notice states that rights also transfer to incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* No, Michigan’s transfer of or rights regulation does not clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, Mich. Admin. Code r. 340.1701b(d)(viii) clearly defines “parent” to include students who have turned 18 years old for whom “a legal guardian has not been appointed by appropriate court proceedings.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Michigan’s transfer of or rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* No, Michigan’s transfer of or rights regulation does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Michigan.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, the Michigan Department of Education’s 2018 Procedural Safeguards Notice clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students who turn 18 years old and for whom a legal guardian has not been appointed by a court, and also that parents have a right to notice. However, this notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring, such as a power of attorney.
