* Yes, the Michigan Department of Education’s 2018 Procedural Safeguards Notice clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students who turn 18 years old and for whom a legal guardian has not been appointed by a court, and also that parents have a right to notice. However, this notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring, such as a power of attorney.
