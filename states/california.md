**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, Cal. Educ. Code § 56041.5 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* No, California’s special education statute does not specify whether rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* Yes, Cal. Educ. Code § 56041.5 clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, Cal. Educ. Code § 56041.5 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “determined to be incompetent under state law.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* No, California’s special education statute does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent the transfer of rights, though private parties have employed “Assignment of Educational Decision-Making Authority” to prevent rights transfers.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* No, the GATOR project has not located a California special education statute or regulation that creates a “special procedure” that prevents parents’ rights from transferring to adult students determined to be unable of giving informed consent. _Meares v. Rim of the World Unified Sch. Dist._, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107474 (D. Cent. Cal. Aug. 13, 2015). _See also Rivera v. Fremont Union High Sch. Dist._, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126043 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 30, 2013) (Plaintiff unsuccessfully sought order that California’s Department of Education adopt special procedures pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(m)(2)).

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to FAPE is violated?_**

* Likely yes. _See Rivera v. Fremont Union High Sch. Dist._, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126043 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 30, 2013) (ALJ dismissed plaintiff’s complaint without prejudice because “at the time, Plaintiff did not hold the Student's educational rights and thus could not represent the Student” although Plaintiff subsequently “corrected that deficiency” through unspecified means).
* However, the district court in _Meares v. Rim of the World Unified Sch. Dist._, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107474 (D. Cent. Cal. Aug. 13, 2015) approved a student’s use of an Assignment of Educational Decision-Making Authority to prevent rights from transferring to him and implied that rights transfers may preclude parents for raising FAPE violations on their own. _See also Santa Clara Unified Sch. Dist._, Cal. State Educ. Agency Nos. 2015030117 & 2014120222, 115 LRP 44329 (Aug. 24, 2015) (finding that a school district failed to honor an adult student’s assignment of decision-making authority to her parents by continuing to correspond with her instead of her parents and requiring the student’s consent on her IEPs).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* No, the GATOR project was unable to locate guidance from the California Department of Education on transfer of rights.
* However, Disability Rights California and Community Alliance for Special Education’s _Special Education Rights and Responsibilities_ manual clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old. Additionally, this manual mentions the Assignment of Educational Decision-Making Authority as an alternative to guardianship that prevents rights transfers.
