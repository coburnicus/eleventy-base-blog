**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* Yes, N.J. Admin. Code 6A:14-2.3(m) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, New Jersey’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* Yes, N.J. Admin. Code 6A:14-2.3(m)(3) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, N.J. Admin. Code 6A:14-2.3(m) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student if the “parent has obtained legal guardianship.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, New Jersey’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent rights from transferring to adult students.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, New Jersey’s transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Likely yes. See B.G. v. Ocean City Bd. of Educ., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135768 (D.N.J. Sept. 26, 2014) and B.A.W. v. E. Orange Bd. Of Educ., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90544 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2010) (both involving adult students as named plaintiffs).
* However, one hearing officer allowed a mother was allowed to present her adult child’s claims under IDEA based in part on an informal “writing” that “he wants his mother to represent his interests in this matter.” However, the student’s writing did not appear dispositive. Instead, in rejecting the school board’s arguments that the student’s mother lacked standing due to New Jersey’s transfer of rights regulation, the hearing officer reasoned that the mother was acting as a representative or advisor described at N.J. Admin. Code 1:6A-5.1(a), which may be a novel interpretation of New Jersey’s transfer of rights regulation. J.O. ex rel. D.O. v. New Milford Bd. of Educ., OAL Dkt No. EDS1503-05 (Feb. 28, 2005).
* Relatedly, at least one hearing officer appears to have failed to apply New Jersey and federal law’s requirement that parents receive notice post transfer, underscoring the importance of this provision. L.H. o/b/o R.H. v. Florence Twp. Bd. of Educ., NJOAL Dkt. No. EDS 6558-02; Agency Dkt. No. 2003-6910, 2002 N.J. AGEN LEXIS 857 (Nov. 6, 2002) (dubiously concluding that the school district “had no responsibility to contact \[R.H.’s father\] because R.H. had attained the age of majority and a transfer of rights already occurred”).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly yes. The New Jersey Department of Education’s 2016 Parental Rights in Special Education resource likely overstates its transfer of rights regulation. Although the resource states that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old “unless a court has appointed a legal guardian,” and that parents have a right to notice post transfer, it fails to mention alternatives to guardianship such as a power of attorney that may prevent parental rights from transferring.
