**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* No, Nebraska’s special education statute does not clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to students when they turn 19 years old. However, the Nebraska Department of Education’s 2004 Graduation Considerations for Students with Disabilities: A Decision-Making Framework for IEP Teams clarifies that parental rights do not transfer to adult students in Nebraska.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, Nebraska’s special education statute does not clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to incarcerated students, presumably because parental rights do not transfer to any adult students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* No, Nebraska’s special education statute does not clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer, presumably because parental rights do not transfer to any adult students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* No, Nebraska’s special education statute does not clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians, presumably because parental rights do not transfer to any adult students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, Nebraska’s special education statute does not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring, presumably because parental rights do not transfer to any adult students. However, independent of Nebraska’s non-transfer policy, because Nev. Rev. Stat. § 79-1162 allows “competent” students to file due process complaints, implicitly students adjudicated incompetent may not do so. 

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, Nebraska’s special education statute does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent, presumably because parental rights do not transfer to any adult students.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Because parental rights do not transfer to adult students, despite the absence of hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Nebraska, parents likely retain this right. That said, Nev. Rev. Stat. § 79-1162 appears to allow “competent” students to file due process complaints, too.
* Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. (superseded by statute) likely does not control given that parental rights do not transfer to adult students. 

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly not. The Nebraska Department of Education’s 2018 IDEA Part B Parents’ Rights in Special Education (Age 3-21): Procedural Safeguards Notice does not provide any information about the transfer of rights in Nebraska.
* However, the Nebraska Department of Education’s 2004 “Technical Assistance Document” entitled Graduation Considerations for Students with Disabilities: A Decision-Making Framework for IEP Teams clarifies that parental rights do not transfer to adult students in Nebraska.
