**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-76d-12(b) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old. (Added in 66 Conn. L.J. 35 (Mar. 1, 2005).)

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* Yes, Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-76d-12(c) clearly states that parental rights also transfer to students if they are incarcerated when they turn 18.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* Yes, Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-76d-12(b) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-76d-12(f) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “determined to be incapacitated by a court.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* Yes, Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-76d-12(e) and (h) clearly state that adult students may prevent parental rights from transferring through a writing to the Board of Education or a power of attorney, respectively. (BOE writing added in 72 Conn. L.J. 6 (Aug. 10, 2010); POA added in 74 Conn. L.J. 51 (June 18, 2013).)

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* Yes, Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-76d-12(g) states that an adult student “may be certified as unable to provide informed consent or to make educational decisions” by “two separate professionals,” in which case parental rights will not transfer to the student. Such certification only lasts for one year and is subject to challenge. (Added in 74 Conn. L.J. 51 (June 18, 2013).)

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to FAPE is violated?_**

* Probably, yes. The district court in _DOE v. Westport Bd. of Educ._, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29911 (D. Conn. Feb. 21, 2020), declined to reverse a hearing officer’s determination that parents lost their right to seek reimbursement under the IDEA after their daughter turned 18 years old and their rights had transferred to her.
* However, note that a school district’s failure to notify parents and students of the transfer of rights may allow parents to bring claims on behalf of their adult students despite rights having transferred if the procedural defect denied them an opportunity to participate in IEP planning and implementation. _Bruno v Greenwich Bd. of Educ._, 2006 US Dist. LEXIS 1885 (D. Conn. Jan. 6, 2006).
* Also, duly executed powers of attorney allowing parents to act as agents in all “claims and litigation” afford parents standing to sue. _Wong v. Bd. of Educ._, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141502 (D. Conn. Aug. 7, 2020); _Reg’l Sch. Dist. No. 1_, 107 LRP 65449 (Conn. State Educ. Agency, Oct. 22, 2007). However, a power of attorney executed after a due process complaint is filed does not retroactively cure the standing defect. _In re Reg’l Sch. Dist. No. 1,_ Conn. State Educ. Agency No. 07-285, 107 LRP 65449 (Oct. 22, 2007).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* No, the Connecticut State Department of Education’s Bureau of Special Education’s 2007 _A Parent’s Guide to Special Education in Connecticut_ likely overstates its transfer of rights regulation. Although the guide clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, it states that “all” rights transfer without noting that parents have a right to notice post transfer. Also, the guide states that parental rights transfer when students turn 18 “unless a court has appointed a legal guardian for your child.” This guidance ignores its transfer of rights provisions expressly mentioning two alternatives to guardianship that prevent rights from transferring.
