**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- No, Oklahoma does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states whether parental rights transfer to adult students. However, Oklahoma’s policy of transferring parental rights to students when they turn 18 years old appears to have been set through agency guidance.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, Oklahoma does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- No, Oklahoma does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- No, Oklahoma does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- No, Oklahoma does not have a statute or regulation that clearly mentions alternatives to guardianship.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, Oklahoma does not have a statute or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Likely yes. However, at least one Oklahoma district court has allowed parents to substitute their adult children as named plaintiffs in order for their suit to proceed. Covey v. Lexington Pub. Sch., 55 IDELR 256, CIV-09-1151-M (W.D. Okla. Dec. 7, 2010).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Mostly not. The Oklahoma State Department of Education‘s 2017 Special Education Handbook does clarify what the State’s special education statute and regulations do not: that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, unless a court has appointed a guardian. But this handbook misstates federal law regarding transfer-of-rights, where it defines an “adult student” as a “student with a disability who is 18 years of age or older whose special education rights have transferred under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).” Federal law does not provide that rights be transferred; rather, federal law authorizes States to choose whether rights shall transfer or not. Similarly, the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s 2014 Parents Rights in Special Education: Notice of Procedural Safeguards re-states what federal law requires should a State like Oklahoma choose for parental rights to transfer when students turn 18 years old, without stating what Oklahoma law provides.
- Moreover, this handbook fails to describe alternatives to guardianship, such as powers of attorney, that may also prevent parental rights from transferring. Similarly, the Oklahoma State Department of Education‘s 2014 Oklahoma’s Secondary Transition Handbook describes guardianship as the only way for avoiding parental rights transferring.
