**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- Yes, both Iowa Code § 256B.6(3) and Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-41.250 clearly state that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- Yes, both Iowa Code § 256B.6(3) and Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-41.250(1)(b) clearly state that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- Yes, both Iowa Code § 256B.6(3) and Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-41.250(1)(c) clearly state that parents have a right to notice.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- Yes, both Iowa Code § 256B.6(3) and Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-41.250(2) clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to adult students “determined to be incompetent by a court or other competent authority.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- No, Iowa’s transfer-of-rights statute and regulation do not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- Yes and no. Although Iowa Code § 256B.6(3) and Iowa Admin. Code r. 281-41.250(2) state that the “director of the department of education may establish standards” for appointing educational representatives for students deemed unable to give informed consent, the Iowa Department of Education’s 2015 Age of Majority – Parent/Guardian Version FAQs suggest that it has not done so.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Yes and no. Parents may pursue claims on their own behalf after their child turns 18 years old (i.e. for tuition reimbursement), but they may no longer assert claims on the child’s behalf.
- The district court in Pratt v. Pleasant Valley Cmty. Sch. Dist. stated that “a parent may not assert claims on the child’s behalf once the latter turns eighteen,” even though the case was filed before the child’s eighteenth birthday and the parent plaintiffs filed a “Notification that \[GL\] Has Formally Authorized Linda Pratt to Represent Him in Educational and Legal Issues,” wherein the child authorized his mother “to continue to represent his interesting in all legal proceedings until his 22nd birthday.” 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193810 (S.D. Ia. Aug. 13, 2015). Further, the district court declined to substitute GL as the party in interest by its own motion. See also In re A.W. v. Cmty. Sch. Dist. & Keystone Area Educ. Agency, Dkt. No. SE-418, 27 Do.E App. Dec. 983 (June 30, 2015) (allowing parent complainants to amend their complaint to add adult child as complainant).
- However, the court recognized GL’s parents’ right to reimbursement did not “evaporate” when GL turned 18 years old and allowed them to pursue this claim for compensation on their own behalf.
- Although the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals’ main holding regarding the statute of limitations in Birmingham v. Omaha Sch. Dist. has been superseded by statute, worth noting is that it appears to have committed two errors relating to its interpretation of the IDEA’s transfer-of-rights provisions. First, it erroneously implied that federal law, not State law, dictates whether parental rights transfer to adult students. Second, it erroneously implied that parents do not have a right to notice post transfer when it reasoned that the 1997 IDEA amendments did not cure the school district’s failure to provide notice to an adult student’s parent ratione temporis. 220 F.3d 850, 853-54 (8th Cir. 2000).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- Yes, the Iowa Department of Education’s 2018 Procedural Safeguards Manual for Parents clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, or before age 18 if they marry or are convicted and sentenced as adults, unless they have “legally been determined to be incompetent under Iowa law.” Also, this manual fails to mention that parents have a right to notice post transfer, although the Department of Education’s 2019 Special Education Eligibility and Evaluation Standards does recognize that the right to notice survives transfer.
- However, both manuals fail to mention alternatives to guardianship, as such as a power of attorney, that may prevent parental rights from transferring. Similarly, the Department’s 2015 Questions and Answers about Age of Majority for Youth fails to do so.
- By contrast, the Department’s 2015 2015 Age of Majority – Parent/Guardian Version FAQs does describe power of attorney as an alternative to guardianship that prevents parental rights from transferring and also references a specific “Power of Attorney for Educational Decision Making” form developed by the Department and available on its Secondary Transition resource library.
