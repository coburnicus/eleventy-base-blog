**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* Yes, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-109.2(a) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, North Carolina’s transfer of rights statute does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* Yes, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-109.2(a)(1) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-109.2(b) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student who has been “determined to be incompetent.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, North Carolina’s transfer of rights statute does not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent rights from transferring to adult students. However, Section 1504-1.21(b)(2)(ii) of the North Carolina State Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction‘s 2018 Policies Governing Services for Students with Disabilities permits adult students to prevent rights from transferring through a power of attorney.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* Yes, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 115C-109.2(b) clearly states, “The State Board shall establish procedures for appointing the parent of the child, or if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual, to represent the educational interests of the child throughout the period of eligibility under this section.” These are described at Section 1504-1.21(b)(2)(iii) of the North Carolina State Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction‘s 2018 Policies Governing Services for Students with Disabilities. As early as 60 days before a student turns 18 years old, two among a list of enumerated qualified professionals must certify in writing that “the adult student is incapable of providing informed consent and that the student has been informed of this decision.” “Incapable of providing informed consent” is defined as being unable to do one of the following:
  * “(A) Understand the nature, extent and probable consequences of a proposed educational program or option on a continuing or consistent basis; 
  * (B) Make a rational evaluation of the benefits or disadvantages of a proposed educational decision or program as compared with the benefits or disadvantages of another proposed educational decision or program on a continuing or consistent basis; or 
  * (C) Communicate such understanding in any meaningful way.” 
  * These certifications must also state how often the adult student’s ability to consent should be reviewed. Adult students may challenge such certifications in writing to the local educational agency.

Virginia’s special procedure is very similar.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Likely yes. A state review officer found that while a mother lacked standing to bring her own IDEA claims, her adult son’s power of attorney authorized her to bring claims on his behalf. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schs. Bd. of Educ., North Carolina State Educ. Agency No. 18 EDC 03019, 119 LRP 20683 (Dec. 18, 2018).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly yes. The North Carolina State Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction‘s 2018 Policies Governing Services for Students with Disabilities clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years, that parental rights also transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration, and that parents have a right to notice post transfer with regard to non-incarcerated students. See id. at NC 1504-1.21. Further, these policies clarify that parental rights are presumed to transfer at age 18 unless the student either “is declared legally incompetent or legally incapacitated by a court of competent jurisdiction;” “designates, in writing, by power of attorney or similar legal document, another competent adult to be the student’s agent to receive notices and to participate in meetings and all other procedures related to the student’s educational program;” or “is certified . . . as unable to provide informed consent.”
* However, the North Carolina State Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction‘s 2016 Parent Rights & Responsibilities in Special Education: Notice of Procedural Safeguards likely overstates its transfer of rights statute and policy. This notice states, “Age 18 is the age of majority in the State of North Carolina and the right to make educational decisions and procedural safeguards transfer to the student at this time. Unless a guardian has been appointed to represent the student, the student represents him or herself.” Thus, this notice fails to mention the other two circumstances in which rights do not transfer expressly stated in North Carolina’s policies: execution of a power of attorney or appointment of an educational representative.
