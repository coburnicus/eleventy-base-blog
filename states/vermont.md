**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* No, the Vermont Agency of Education’s 2018 Notice of Procedural Safeguards: Rights of Parents of Students with Disabilities contains no information about the transfer of rights.
