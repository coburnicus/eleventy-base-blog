* Yes, La. Admin. Code tit. 28, § 520(A) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* Yes, La. Admin. Code tit. 28, § 520(A)(1)(b) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, La. Admin. Code tit. 28, § 520(A)(1)(a) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, La. Admin. Code tit. 28, § 520(A) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students who have “been determined to be incompetent under state law.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Louisiana’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure”  to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* Yes, La. Admin. Code tit. 28, § 520(B) states “a student’s parent may allege to the \[local education agency\] that the student lacks the ability to provide informed consent with respect to his or her educational program,” which allegation the student may contest in writing or orally. While the student’s “position is final and unappealable,” a parent’s uncontested allegation will allow the parent to retain parental rights.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Yes. In re: Student with a Disability v. Louisiana State Educ. Agency, 115 L.R.P. 33576, No. 2015-6423-IDEA (May 28, 2015). See also Reyes v. Manor Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 16-50542 (5th Cir. May 11, 2017).

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, the Louisiana Department of Education’s 2020 Louisiana’s Educational Rights of Children with Disabilities: Special Education Processes + Procedural Safeguards clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old or are incarcerated, unless they have been “determined, under applicable state laws, to lack the capacity to make educational decisions.” It also states that parents have a right to notice post transfer, while failing to mention alternatives to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, that may prevent parental rights from transferring.
