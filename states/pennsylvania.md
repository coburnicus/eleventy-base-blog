**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* No, Pennsylvania does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students rights at the age of majority, which is 21 years old in Pennsylvania. See Pa. Dep’t of Educ. Act, Part B Policies and Proc., July 1, 2002, p. 12 ("The age of majority is reached in Pennsylvania when the individual reaches 21 years of age. Likewise, for purposes of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the age of majority is reached for both nondisabled students and students with disabilities when they reach 21 years of age. PA does not transfer rights at the age of majority to any student; therefore, rights under IDEA are not transferred to students with disabilities."). See also Jonathan T. v. Lackawanna Trail Sch. Dist., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2915 at n.4 (Mid. D. Penn. Feb. 26, 2004).

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* No, Pennsylvania does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states if parental rights transfer to incarcerated students, as rights do not transfer to adult students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* No, Pennsylvania does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that parents have a right to notice, as rights do not transfer to adult students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* No, Pennsylvania does not have a statute or regulation that clearly states that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians, as rights do not transfer to adult students without them.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, Pennsylvania does not have a statute or regulation that clearly mentions alternatives to guardianship that avoid parental rights transferring, as rights do not transfer to adult students.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* No, Pennsylvania does not have a statute or regulation for appointing representatives for adult students, as rights do not transfer to adult students. Cf. 

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* “The parent is the educational decisionmaker in Pennsylvania until his or her child reaches the age of twenty-one. See 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1991.” Dudley v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist. 58 IDELR 12, No. 10-2749 (E.D. Penn. Nov. 29, 2011).
* However, where a 21-year-old student’s parents brought a FAPE claim, the hearing officer interpreted 20 U.S.C. § 1415(m)(2) to authorize him to determine the student incapable of providing informed consent and appointing the student’s parent’s as representatives for the purpose of their due process complaint, which had been filed before the student turned 20 years old. In re Cheltenham Twp. Sch. Dist., Penn. State Educ. Agency No. 19663-17-18, 118 LRP 1432 (Nov. 20, 2017) and In re Neshaminy Twp. Sch. Dist., Penn. State Educ. Agency No. 19662-17-18, 118 LRP 1429 (Nov. 20, 2017).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly not. The Pennsylvania Bureau of Special Education’s 2018 Procedural Safeguards Notice does not expressly state that parental rights do not transfer to students. 
* Also, a bit confusingly, the Pennsylvania Department of Education’s 2018 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part B: Policies and Procedures under 34 CFR §§ 300.101—300.176 states, “The age of majority in Pennsylvania is 21 years, thus IDEA rights of parents do not transfer to students at age 18.” This could be written more clearly to state that parental rights under the IDEA do not transfer at all. 
* However, these policies do state that while parental rights under IDEA do not transfer to students, FERPA rights regarding access to educational records do transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.
