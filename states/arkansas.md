**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, 5-18-008 Ark. Code R. § 08.3 & 5-18-009 Ark. Code R. § 07.1 clearly state that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* Yes, 5-18-009 Ark. Code R. § 07.1.1(C) clearly states that parental rights also transfer to students if they are incarcerated at the time they are incarcerated.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* Yes, 5-18-009 Ark. Code R. § 07.1.1 clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* Yes, 5-18-009 Ark. Code R. § 07.1.1 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students if “determined to be incompetent or incapacitated under State law.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Arkansas’ special education regulations do not mention alternatives to guardianship that prevent the transfer of parental rights.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* Yes, 5-18-009 Ark. Code R. § 07.1.2 requires LEA’s to use “procedures established by the State” to appoint an educational representative if the student “can be determined to not have the ability to provide informed consent.”

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Mostly yes. The Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education’s 2020 _Special Education Process Guide_ clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old and that parents have a right to notice.

  However, this guide likely overstates its regulations, where it states, “All other rights transfer to the child unless he or she has been determined incompetent or incapacitated by a court order.” Although Arkansas’ transfer of rights regulations do not expressly mention alternatives to guardianship, presumably an alternative such as an education power of attorney would also prevent parental rights transfers.

  By contrast, Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education’s [Procedural Safeguards Notice](http://dese.ade.arkansas.gov/divisions/learning-services/special-education/policy-regulations/your-rights-under-idea) for parents does not mention transfer of rights.
