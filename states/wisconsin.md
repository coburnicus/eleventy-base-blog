**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

- Yes, Wisc. Stat. § 115.807 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

- No, Wisconsin’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not clearly state that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

- Yes, Wisc. Stat. 115.807(1) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

- Yes, Wisc. Stat. § 115.807 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students who have been “adjudicated incompetent.”

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

- Yes, Wisc. Stat. § 115.807(4) states, “The local educational agency shall provide the individual and the individual’s parents with information on supported decision-making under ch. 53, other alternatives to guardianship, and strategies to remain engaged in the individual’s secondary education.”

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

- No, Wisconsin’s transfer-of-rights regulation does not create a special procedure to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

- Yes. In re: Student with a Disability, Wisc. State Educ. Agency No. LEA-13-013, 62 IDELR 249, 113 LRP 46807 (June 10, 2013) (noting that the parents’ previous complaint, No. LEA-13-006, was dismissed due to lack of standing, and the current complaint was refiled by the student). The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals has held similarly. Loch v. Edwardsville Sch. Dist. No. 7, 327 F. App’x 647 (7th Cir. 2010).
- Further, the hearing officer in LEA-13-006, 113 LRP 47193 (Apr. 3, 2013) held that adult students may not assign IDEA rights using a power of attorney because Wisconsin’s power of attorney statute only recognizes use of these instruments for property or financial matters, not educational decisions.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer-of-rights?**

- No, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction’s 2018 Procedural Safeguards Notice does not mention the transfer of parental rights.
- Note that in 2018 Wisconsin enacted a statute formally recognizing supported decision-making agreements, which presumably may be used to navigate transfer-of-rights concerns and should be incorporated into future guidance.
