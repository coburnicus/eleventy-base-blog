**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?**

* Yes, Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 160-4-7-.06(3) clearly states that clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old. Its qualification that notice be provided only “if” parental rights will transfer likely refers to students subject to guardianship orders.

**Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?**

* No, Georgia’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state whether parental rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?**

* No, Georgia’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?**

* No, Georgia’s transfer of rights regulation does not clearly state that parental rights do not transfer to students subject to guardianship orders.

**Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?**

* No, Georgia’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?**

* No, Georgia’s transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure for determining adult students to lack capacity to give informed consent.

**Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Georgia.

**Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?**

* Yes, the Georgia Department of Education’s undated _Special Education Rules Implementation Manual_ clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old: “they become their own educational decision makers, unless a court decides they are not able to make these decisions.” In so doing, it clarifies what is likely implicit in the regulations: that parental rights do not transfer to students subject to guardianship orders. Additionally, the manual appears to encourage school districts to “inform parents of other options or about where to get more information about guardianship, powers of attorney, and any other options” that may prevent parental rights from transferring.
