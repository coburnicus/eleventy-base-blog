**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* No, New York does not have a specific statute or regulation clearly stating its policy that parental rights do not transfer to students when they attain the age of majority. However, New York’s non-transfer policy is clearly stated in New York State Education Department guidance. See Memo on "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B Final Supplemental Regulations Issued December 1, 2008 and Effective December 31, 2008 – Non- Regulatory Guidance,” (May 2009) (stating that "NYS law does not grant a child who has reached the age of majority all rights previously granted to parents under IDEA"). See also Application of a Student with a Disability, NYSED Appeal No. 17-077 (Nov. 15, 2017); Application of a Student with a Disability, NYSED Appeal No. 11-121 (Dec. 5, 2011).

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* No, the New York State Education Department’s 2017 Procedural Safeguards Notice: Rights of Parents of Children with Disabilities, Ages 3-21 contains no information about New York’s policy not to transfer parental rights to students when they attain majority.
