**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, 200, 20 R.I. Code R. § 6.8.1(U)(1) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* Yes, 200, 20 R.I. Code R. § 6.8.1(U)(2) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students at the time of incarceration.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* Yes, 200, 20 R.I. Code R. § 6.8.1(U)(1)(a) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, 200, 20 R.I. Code R. § 6.8.1(U)(1) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to “a child with a disability who has been determined to be incompetent under State law.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* No, Rhode Island’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* No, Rhode Island’s transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure for appointing representatives to adult students deemed unable to give informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not located hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Rhode Island.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* Mostly yes. The Rhode Island Department of Education’s 2019 Procedural Safeguards Notice Model Form clearly states that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, “unless another legal determination is made.” While this phrase might be interpreted to include alternative legal arrangements to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, the language could be clearer. Also, this notice fails to state that parents have a right to notice post transfer pursuant to 200, 20 R.I. Code R. § 6.8.1(U)(1)(a) and under federal law.
* Note that in 2019 Rhode Island enacted a statute recognized supported decision-making agreements which presumably may be used to navigate transfer of rights concerns and should be incorporated into future guidance.
