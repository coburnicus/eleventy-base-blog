**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**	

* Yes, Ohio Admin. Code 3301-51-05(D)(2)(a) clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* Yes, Ohio Admin. Code 3301-51-05(D)(2)(b) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students upon incarceration.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* Yes, Ohio Admin. Code 3301-51-05(D)(2)(c) clearly states that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, Ohio Admin. Code 3301-51-05(D)(2) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to students “determined to be incompetent under Ohio law.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, Ohio’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* No, Ohio’s transfer of rights regulation does not create a special procedure that prevents parental rights from transferring to adult students deemed unable of giving informed consent.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**	

* Yes. A district court held that a hearing officer erred in not dismissing a parent’s due process complaint where the parent’s child had turned 18 years old before the complaint was filed. Ravenna School Board of Education v. Williams, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111817 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 9, 2012). Adult students may confer standing on their parents through a power of attorney. Beachwood City Sch. Dist., 104 LRP 25307 (Ohio Dept. of Educ., Mar. 11, 2004).
* Note that at least one hearing officer has found an IDEA violation where the school district failed to notify both the student and parents of the transfer of rights before or when they student turned 17 years old. Worthington City Sch. Dist., Ohio State Educ. Agency No. CP 0016-2012, 59 IDELR 29, 112 LRP 23481 (Mar. 30, 2012). But failure to provide notice does not cause a FAPE violation without showing substantive harm. Gibson v. Forest Hill Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81908 at n.4 (S.D. Ohio June 11, 2013).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly no. The Ohio Department of Education’s 2012 Whose IDEA Is This?: A Parent’s Guide to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) states that parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, but fails to mention that guardianship or alternatives to guardianship prevent parental rights from transferring and that parents have a right to notice post transfer, despite clear statements in Ohio Admin. Code 3301-51-05(D)(2). 
* Furthermore, the Department’s 2017 A Guide to Parent Rights in Special Education: Special Education Procedural Safeguards Notice fails to mention the transfer of IDEA rights at all.
