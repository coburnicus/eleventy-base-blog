**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.0 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**

* No, Delaware’s transfer of rights regulation does not specify whether rights transfer to incarcerated students.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**

* No, 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.1.1.1 states that parents only have a right to notice of the transfer at the time of the transfer, but not post transfer. This provision likely conflicts with federal law, which requires that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**

* Yes, 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.1.1 clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to an adult student who has a “court-appointed guardian.”

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**

* Yes, 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.1.2 clearly states that an adult student “may authorize an adult agent to exercise rights through execution of a power of attorney or a standard voluntary grant of authority form published by the Department of Education.”

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure” to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_**

* Yes, 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.1.3 states that the IEP Team may determine an adult student incapable of providing informed consent. Only if a student’s “capacity is uncertain” must is a school psychologist required to participate in the determination. _Id._ at § 20.1.3.1.

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated if their rights transfer?_**

* Unclear. The GATOR project team has not found hearing officer or court decisions that address this issue in Delaware.

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**

* No, the Delaware Department of Education’s Exception Children Resources’ 2019 _Notice of Procedural Safeguards_ likely overstates its transfer of rights regulation where it states that “all” parental rights to students when they turn 18 years old unless either a court has appointed a guardian for the student or the IEP team has determined that the student lacks the capacity to make informed educational decisions.
* This notice also ignores 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.1.2, which expressly allows adult students to execute a power of attorney or appoint an educational representative. Also, contrary to this notice, federal law requires school districts to notify parents of the transfer of rights at least twice: once, one year prior to the transfer, and again upon transfer. Last, notwithstanding 14-926 Del. Admin. Code § 20.1.1.1, federal law requires that parents have a right to notice post transfer.
* Further, this notice fails to mention how supported decision-making agreements may be used to navigate transfer of rights concerns following Delaware’s enactment of a statute in 2016 formally recognizing these agreements.
* In addition, although the Parent Information Center of Delaware, Inc.’s 2013 _Parents Are Key: A Manual about the Rights and Responsibilities for Parents of Children with Special Education Needs in Delaware_ not only misinterprets Delaware’s transfer of rights regulation, it fails to mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent transfer of rights.
