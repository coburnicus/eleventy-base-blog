**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) rights transfer to adult students?_**

* Yes, 511 Ind. Admin. Code 7-43-5 clearly states that parental rights generally transfer to students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Is there a law or regulation clearly stating if parents’ IDEA rights transfer to incarcerated students?_**	

* Yes, 511 Ind. Admin. Code 7-43-5(c) clearly states that parental rights transfer to incarcerated students when they turn 18 years old.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that parents have a right to notice post transfer?_**	

* Yes, 511 Ind. Admin. Code 7-43-5(f) that parents have a right to notice post transfer.

**_Does the law or regulation clearly state that rights do not transfer to adult students with legal guardians or conservators?_**	

* Yes, 511 Ind. Admin. Code 7-43-5(b)(1) clearly states that parental rights do not transfer to adult students subject to guardianship orders. 

**_Does the law or regulation clearly mention alternatives to guardianship?_**	

* No, Indiana’s transfer of rights regulation does not mention alternatives to guardianship that may prevent parental rights from transferring.

**_Is there a law or regulation creating a “special procedure”  to appoint representatives for adult students deemed unable to give informed consent?_** 	

* Yes, 511 Ind. Admin. Code 7-43-6(f-g) describes a procedure for appointing an educational representative either at the student’s request or if two persons, including a physician, licensed nurse practitioner, psychologist, of licensed clinical social worker, determine that the student is “incapable of providing informed consent.” Note: Indiana’s durable power of attorney statute is not a “special procedure” within the meaning of 20 U.S.C. § 1415(m)(2). Weyrick v. New Albany-Floyd County Consol. Sch. Corp., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26435 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 23, 2004).

**_Do parents lose the right to make a due process complaint or to sue if their students’ right to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) is violated?_**

* Because Indiana’s district courts fall within the 7th Circuit, like Illinois courts they must follow Loch v. Edwardsville Sch. Dist. No. 7, 327 Fed. Appx. 647 (7th Cir. 2009), where the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that only an 18-year-old student, not her parents, could sue her school. See also Sandlin v. Switz. Cnty. Sch. Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72689 n.3 (S.D. Ind. Aug. 17, 2009) (implying that claims on behalf of adult students may only be brought by the students post transfer).
* Parents may bring IDEA suits on their adult children’s behalf pursuant to a duly executed power of attorney. Weyrick v. New Albany-Floyd County Consol. Sch. Corp., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26435 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 23, 2004).

**_Does state educational agency guidance clearly explain the applicable laws and/or regulations regarding transfer of rights?_**	

* Mostly yes. Although the Indiana Department of Education’s 2019 Notice of Procedural Safeguards likely overstates its transfer of rights regulation, where it states that “all” parental rights transfer to students when they turn 18 years old, this notice does indicate that parents “will continue to receive any notice required” by Indiana law, per 511 Ind. Admin. Code 7-43-5(f). 
* However, the notice fails to mention alternatives to guardianship, such as a power of attorney, that may prevent parental rights from transferring. 
* Note that in 2019 Indiana enacted a statute formally recognizing supported decision-making agreements, which presumably may be used to navigate transfer of rights concerns and should be incorporated into future guidance.
