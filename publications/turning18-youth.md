        <h2>What Youth with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Should Know</h2>
        <p>In these videos, self-advocates talk about findings from a GATOR research project. They explain transfer-of-rights, transition planning, and turning 18. They also talk about alternatives to guardianship and what self-advocacy and decision-making means to them.</p>
